This webpage shows the structural property and the system identification result of an 18-story steel frame structure.

# Structural property
A one-third scale 18-story steel frame structure is mounted on a shaking table  which provides a uniaxial base excitation for the structure. The strcuture is modeled by an 18-DOF shear model and its structural properties are presented in the table.

# System identification
System identification is conducted using acceleration responses of the structure subject to the input ground motion as shown below. The first and the second natural frequencies, damping ratios, and mode shapes are extracted.
