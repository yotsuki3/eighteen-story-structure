1. 18-Story Steel Structure - Simulated Data

An 18-DOF shear model is simulated. The following table shows the weight values and the initial inter-story stiffness values of all DOFs for the initial model. To construct an “actual” structure, the stiffness value of each story is modified to "actual" stifness value in the table. Modal properties of the “actual” structure are directly used as “experimental” modal properties. It is assumed that only the seven DOFs (#1, #4, #7, #9, #12, #15, and #18) are instrumented with sensors and only the first four modes are “measured” and available for model updating.

2. 18-Story Steel Structure - Experimental Data

Experimental data from shaking table tests of a one-third scale 18-story steel frame structure is used for demonstrating the model updating procedure. Floor masses are accurately weighed, but all 18 inter-story stiffness values require updating. The structure is mounted on a shake table which provides a uniaxial base excitation for the structure. It is assumed that only the six DOFs (#3, #6, #9, #12, #15, and #18) are instrumented with sensors. Modal properties of the 18-story structure are then extracted from the experimental data. The first and the second extracted modes are used for model updating.
